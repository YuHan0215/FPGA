Function Introduction:

Users can connect to the Bluetooth module using a mobile app, enabling them to remotely control the obstacle avoidance car and adjust its speed (divided into Fast mode and Slow mode).
When there is an obstacle in front of the obstacle avoidance car, it is only allowed to reverse the car.
When the car turns, the corresponding direction indicator light on the front of the car lights up.
